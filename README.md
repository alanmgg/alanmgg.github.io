<p><em>Hi there! I'm Alan, a young but seasoned developer, an HTML and CSS enthusiast, a guy a bit obsessed with code quality. I am also a co-founder of OrangeCorp, a business project created with friends. Currently I want to develop within a company and grow, contributing my knowledge and gaining experience to climb positions within it. If you have a project that you want to start or you think you need my help with something, get in touch. :bulb:
